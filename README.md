# Travel
This repository contains travel guides to places which I and my family (My wife Julia and two childer Adelina and Miron) visited. Some links may not be working as I can't keep track of their relevance, but if you find any mistakes or real links to places, feel free to submit a change request. I hope our experience will help you in future travels and you will be able to add something new to this guide. Have a nice trip! 

All guides will be published in Russian as I can show all my emotions and you can easily translate them via Google translate
